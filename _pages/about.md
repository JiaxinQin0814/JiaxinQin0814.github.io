Hi, My name is Jiaxin Qin (秦佳鑫 in Chinese). I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring Artificial Intelligence in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China.  I have had a good exchanging experience in [UC, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).

Now I am working with [Zixuan Zhang](https://zhangzx-uiuc.github.io/) in UIUC  BLENDER advised by  Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) (onsite). Previously I am honored  to be advised by  Professor [Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=JNhNacoAAAAJ) in RUC . I also had  a wonderful time collaborating with [Banghua Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~banghua/) in UC, Berkely.   

I have a wide-ranging passion for Natural Language Processing, where my work primarily focuses on Large Language Models and Knowledge Editing. Additionally, I hold a strong fascination for reinforcement learning.

Hi, My name is Jiaxin Qin (秦佳鑫 in Chinese). I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring Artificial Intelligence in [GSAI](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China.  I had a good exchanging experience in [UC, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2023.

I am honored  to be advised by  Professor [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html) in UIUC and  Professor [Wayne Xin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=JNhNacoAAAAJ) in RUC. I also had  a wonderful time collaborating with [Banghua Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=iyDxq0EAAAAJ) in UC, Berkely. 

I have a wide-ranging passion for Natural Language Processing, where my work primarily focuses on Large Language Models and Knowledge Editing. Additionally, I hold a strong fascination for reinforcement learning.
